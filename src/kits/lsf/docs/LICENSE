Severity 1: 	(Fatal) these are production critical issues that cause 
the product or operating system to fail completely  (crash or hang), 
resulting in production downtime, and/or result in irretrievable 
corruption or loss of data. There is no work-around or solution to the 
problem.
* Initial Response: 	1 business hour (logged via 9 to 5 number and/or 
e-mail)
* Work Plan:		6 hours from Initial Response
* Status Updates:		daily
Note: Severity 1 problems will be worked on during off-hours as

3.  ESCALATION PROCESS AND EXCLUSIONS

(a) Target Response Times.  Due to the potentially idiosyncratic 
nature of any support problem, the response times set forth in this 
agreement constitute the targeted goals of the Support Services to be 
provided. Platform shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to meet 
the target times. Sporadic failures to meet these targeted times shall 
not constitute a failure by Platform to perform a material provision 
of these Support Terms.

(b) Support Ticket Prioritization. Support Tickets are assigned a 
priority by Licensee when logged. Tickets may be prioritized from S4 
(low) to S1 (high). Platform will evaluate the ticket priority that 
has been assigned by Licensee and any disagreement regarding the 
appropriate priority between Platform and Licensee will be resolved 
through discussion between the parties, acting reasonably.  Support 
Tickets logged by Licensee without a priority shall be treated as S3 
by default. Tickets that are logged to support@platform.com or via 
phone are responded to from 9am to 5pm local hours. 

(c) Support Ticket Escalation.  Either the Licensee or a Platform 
Support Engineer can escalate a ticket by changing the ticket's 
priority. If Licensee changes a ticket's priority, Platform shall 
evaluate the change in priority in accordance with the process 
outlined in subsection 3(b).

(d)  Exclusions. Support Services do not include installation, 
consulting, education, training, customization and other services, or
additional software products or components that Platform markets 
separately from the Software or charges additional license fees for.

4.	TERM
Term.  These Support Terms become effective on receipt by Licensee of 
an email containing the license key for the Software to which these 
Support Terms relate and continue for a period of one (1) year (a 
"Term"), unless Licensee orders additional Terms of Support Services.
