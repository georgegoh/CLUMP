# Misc batch parameters/switches of the Lava system

# Lava administrator will receive all the error mails produced by Lava
# and have the permission to reconfigure the system (Use an ordinary user 
# name, or create a special account such as lsf. Don't define as root)

# The parameter values given below are for the purpose of testing a new 
# installation.  Jobs submitted to the Lava system will be started on
# batch server hosts quickly.  However, this configuration may not be 
# suitable for a production use.  You may need some control on job scheduling, 
# such as jobs should not be started when host load is high, a host should not 
# accept more than one job within a short period time, and job scheduling 
# interval should be longer to give hosts some time adjusting load indices 
# after accepting jobs.
#
# Therefore, it is suggested, in production use, to define DEFAULT_QUEUE 
# to normal queue, MBD_SLEEP_TIME to 60, SBD_SLEEP_TIME to 30

Begin Parameters
DEFAULT_QUEUE  = normal   #default job queue name
MBD_SLEEP_TIME = 20       #mbatchd scheduling interval (60 secs is default)
SBD_SLEEP_TIME = 15       #sbatchd scheduling interval (30 secs is default)
JOB_ACCEPT_INTERVAL = 1   #interval for any host to accept a job 
                          # (default is 1 (one-fold of MBD_SLEEP_TIME))
End Parameters
