5. REQUIREMENTS FOR REDISTRIBUTION
a. Should you choose to Incorporate the Program and license it under Your own license agreement. Your license agreement must contain the following: 
i.  terms and conditions that comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; 
ii.   a disclaimer, on behalf of Platform, of all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
iii.   total exclusion for liability for Platform for any and all damages, including, without limitation; direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, including lost profits; and
iv. express statement that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone and not by Platform.
b.	You may not modify or interfere with any copyright or intellectual property rights notices in the Program.
 
6. INDEMNIFICATION UPON REDISTRIBUTION
Your Incorporation of the Program into a commercial product offering will only be permitted if You do so in a manner that does not create potential liability for Platform. Should You Incorporate the Program in a commercial product offering, You hereby agree to defend and indemnify Platform against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against Platform to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of You in connection with Your Incorporation of the Program in a commercial product offering. In order to qualify for indemnification, Platform must: a) promptly notify You in writing of such claim, and b) allow You to control, and cooperate with You in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. Platform may participate in any such claim at its own expense.   Should You fail to respond to or defend such claim, then Platform reserves the right to do so at Your sole expense.

For example, You might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. If You then make performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are Your responsibility alone. Under this section, You would have to defend claims against Platform related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires Platform to pay any damages as a result, You must pay those damages.
