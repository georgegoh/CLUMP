/*
 * This code comes from John the Ripper password cracker, with reentrant
 * and crypt(3) interfaces added, but optimizations specific to password
 * cracking removed.
 *
 * Written by Solar Designer <solar@openwall.com> in 1998-2002, and placed
 * in the public domain.
 *
 * There's absolutely no warranty.
 *
 * It is my intent that you should be able to use this on your system,
 * as a part of a software package, or anywhere else to improve security,
 * ensure compatibility, or for any other purpose. I would appreciate
 * it if you give credit where it is due and keep your modifications in
 * the public domain as well, but I don't require that in order to let
 * you place this code and any modifications you make under a license
 * of your choice.
 *
 * This implementation is compatible with OpenBSD bcrypt.c (version 2a)
 * by Niels Provos <provos@physnet.uni-hamburg.de>, and uses some of his
 * ideas. The password hashing algorithm was designed by David Mazieres
 * <dm@lcs.mit.edu>.
 *
 * There's a paper on the algorithm that explains its design decisions:
 *
 *      http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html
 *
 * Some of the tricks in BF_ROUND might be inspired by Eric Young's
 * Blowfish library (I can't be sure if I would think of something if I
 * hadn't seen his code).
