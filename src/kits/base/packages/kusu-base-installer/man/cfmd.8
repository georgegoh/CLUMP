.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The cfmd is the client daemon for Cluster File Management (CFM).  It listens for broadcast messages which signal it to update the cluster.  When an update message is received it checks that it is for the nodes nodegroup, and that it is for a newer update than it has already performed.
.LP 
When a valid update request is received it invokes the \fBcfmclient\fR to perform the work of updating files and packages/components.
