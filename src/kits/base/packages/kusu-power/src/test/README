Power Management for Virtual Machine
1. The plug-in script "vmpower.py" is in SVN in directory "com.platform.power/src/powerplugins".
2. For updating the configuration file we can use a python script scavmpowerconf which takes arguments for vm power management and updates "/opt/scali/etc/scapower.conf" for the node(s) specified.
You can see the Usage of the script for details.
Inputs required are:
<nodename>
<hostmachineip>
<hostmachineusername>
<hostmachinepassword>
<vmwarename>
This script can take list of nodes and list of virtual machine names as well for updating.

Note:- virtual machine name should not have spaces in it.

Example:-
Machine Setup:
PM: PMServer
Node Name of vm (name by which PM communicated with machine): node1
VM machine name by which host machine identifies the VM: RHEL4.vmx
Host Machine and it's IP (Machine where vm is hosted on): hostmc, 172.11.0.111
Steps:
1. Run command on PMServer to add information related to VM machine in configuration file (scapower.conf):
<Path>/scavmpowerconf node1 172.11.0.111 root Letmein RHEL4.vmx
2. Use power command for switch on and off the VM here on:
power node1 on
power node1 off
