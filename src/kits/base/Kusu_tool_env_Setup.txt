           Kusu Tool Test Environment Setup
           --------------------------------


The steps below outline how to create a test/dev environment for
the Kusu tools.  These steps will be reduced once a repository 
containing the base kit is available.  Installing the 

1. Install a Fedora 6 machine.

2. Install the following additional packages:
	   mysql
	   mysql-server
	   dhcp
	   xinetd
	   tftp-server
	   syslinux
	   httpd
	   python
	   python-devel
	   MySQL-python
	   createrepo
   Run:  service mysqld start 
   
3. Check-out the Kusu source

4. Goto: kusu/sandbox/kusu/trunk/src/kits/base/packages/kusu-base-installer/sql
   and run:  prepdb.sh
   Several of the tools can now be run if the PYTHONPATH is set.

5. Build the kit.  Goto: kusu/sandbox/kusu/trunk/src/kits/base/  and run
	 make

6. Go to the RPM directory and install:
      kusu-base-node
      kusu-base-installer
      initrd-templates

7. Goto: kusu/sandbox/kusu/trunk/src/kits/base/packages/kusu-base-installer/sbin/
   Run:  /bin/sh S01KusuSetup

8. For running the imaging tools it is necessary to setup a fake repository.
   Make the directory:   /depot/repos/1/Fedora6/RPMS
   Copy the RPMs from the Fedora DVD into this directory.
   Copy the RPMs from the base kit into this directory.
   Goto /depot/repos/1/Fedora6/  and run:  createrepo RPMS/

9. It is also necessary to modify the database so that the installer node is
   your machine.  Run the following:
	# mysql kusudb
	mysql>  update appglobals set kvalue='{Your Machine}' where kname='PrimaryInstaller' ;
	mysql>  update networks set network='172.25.243.0', subnet='255.255.255.0', gateway='172.25.243.2', startip='172.25.243.200' where netid=1;         (Use your own network settings)

   Other changes may be needed in the netorks, and nics tables depending on your setup. 
	

10. Run:  export PYTHONPATH=/opt/kusu/lib

11. The tools in /opt/kusu/bin, and /opt/kusu/sbin should now run.
